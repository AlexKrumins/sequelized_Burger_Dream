# What the project does:
The project provides a user with a front-end interface that interacts with multiple tables in a globally accessible database.
# Why the project is useful:
The project demonstrates the coder's ability to:
- Use Sequelize and API Routes to populate and manipulate data in the database
- Use the GET/PUT/POST/DELETE ajax codes to manipulate database
- Use the responses from the queries along with Handlebars & CSS to build HTML pages
- Deploy to Heroku using process.env.port
# How users can get started with the project
- Begin by navigating to the 'create chef' page and put a chef's name into the database.
- Create a burger on the 'create burger' page and attribute it to a chef currently in the database.
- View the menu. You can see all of the burgers in the database as well as burgers made by individual chefs.
- Note how the left side of the page is populated with Burgers to be devoured and the right side is populated by Burgers that have been devoured already.
- The buttons to devour/recreate the Burgers change their Boolean 'devoured' value within the database.
- The burgers can be fed to the Baku (mythical eater of dreams) to remove them from the database.
- The chef can be fired and all of their burgers sent away along with them.
